# Backend architecture

NestJS **modular monolith**: one deployable, one Neon PostgreSQL database, strong module boundaries.
This is the approved design from the Phase 3A proposal; this file is the day-to-day reference.

## Layout

```
src/
  main.ts                 bootstrap only
  app.module.ts           wires the modules together
  config/                 typed, validated environment config
  database/               TypeORM connection, TransactionRunner, migrations/, CLI data-source
  platform/               HTTP plumbing only: exception filter, validation pipe, request id, logging
  shared-kernel/          LearningLevel, DomainError. Add here only what is truly domain-wide.
  modules/<name>/         one folder per domain module (below)
test/                     architecture rules + e2e
docs/                     this file
```

There is deliberately no `common/` or `utils/` folder.

## Modules

| Module | Owns | May import |
|---|---|---|
| identity | admin accounts, roles, auth, guards | none |
| curriculum | courses and **modules** (product term; keep it in code and UI) | identity |
| lessons | lessons, blocks, level variants, level availability, level resolution, preview | identity, curriculum, scripture, media, quizzes |
| scripture | structured Scripture references | identity |
| media | media library and storage adapter | identity |
| quizzes | quizzes, questions, options | identity |
| publishing | workflow transitions, audit events, published snapshots | identity, lessons, curriculum |
| delivery | learner read API (no tables) | publishing |
| health | liveness and DB readiness | none |

Rules (enforced by `test/architecture.spec.ts`):

- A module imports another module only through that module's `index.ts`.
- Only the dependencies in the table are allowed, and there are no cycles.
- `config`, `database`, `platform` and `shared-kernel` never import feature modules.
- Cross-module links are plain id columns, not TypeORM relations between modules' entities.

Planned internal shape of a module (create folders only when they have content):
`api/` (controllers, DTOs), `application/` (use cases), `domain/` (pure rules), `persistence/` (entities, repositories).

## HTTP conventions

- All routes are under `/api/v1`, except `GET /health` and `GET /health/db`.
- Every request has an `x-request-id` (generated if absent) that is echoed in the response and in error bodies.
- Errors always look like `{ statusCode, code, message, details?, requestId }`.
  Throw a `DomainError` subclass (`NotFoundError`, `ConflictError`, `BusinessRuleError`) from business code;
  the global filter maps it to 404 / 409 / 422. Unexpected errors become a generic 500.
- Request bodies are validated by a global `ValidationPipe` (whitelist, reject unknown fields, transform).
  Validation failures return `code: VALIDATION_FAILED` with per-field `details`.

## Database

- `synchronize` is off. Schema changes are migrations only, in `src/database/migrations`.
- Each module registers its entities with `TypeOrmModule.forFeature`; `autoLoadEntities` picks them up.
- Multi-write use cases run through `TransactionRunner.run(manager => ...)` and pass `manager` explicitly to repositories.
- Migration commands (each builds first): `npm run migration:show | migration:run | migration:revert`.
  `npm run migration:create` scaffolds an empty migration file.

## Testing

- `npm test` unit tests, colocated as `*.spec.ts`, plus the architecture rules.
- `npm run test:e2e` boots the real app against the database in `.env` (read-only checks).
